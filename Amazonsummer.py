#There are three robots named Ray, Ben and Kevin. Initially Ray has a string S of length N.
#while the other two robots have empty strings. We can make either of the following moves:
#Move |: Remove the first character from Ray’s string and append it to Ben’s string.
#Move 2:Remove the last character from Ben’s string and append it to Kvin’s string.
#You must perform either of the two moves mentioned above in such a way that the strings left
#with Ray and Ben are empty and the string left with Kevin is lexicographically the smallest.
#Your task is to return this lexicographically smallest string that Kevin has after completing this activity.
#Note: For any two given strings, a string is said to be lexicographically smaller than the other
#if it comes before the other string in the dictionary

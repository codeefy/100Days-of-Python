# In this problem, we are given a string s and an integer n. We have to find the number of occurrences of 'a' in the string s repeated n times.
#  For example, if s = 'abcac' and n = 10, the string s will be repeated 10 times to form a new string 'abcacabcacabcacabcacabcacabcacabcacabcacabcacabcacabcacabcac'.
#  The number of occurrences of 'a' in the new string is 4. So, the output will be 4.

# The idea is to find the number of occurrences of 'a' in the string s and then multiply it by 
# the number of times the string s is repeated in the new string.
